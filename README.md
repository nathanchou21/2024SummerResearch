Final Plots can be seen in the ["final plots folder" ](https://github.com/nathanchou21/2024SummerResearch/tree/main/final%20plots)

Data from the [North American Drought Monitor]([url](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/nadm/indices/spi/div)) is brought into GIS.

For each data pointed needed in one of the final plots, SPI statistics are interpolated to a raster file covering the areas of interest.

Boundaries from Temperate Praries, West-Central Semi-Arid Praries, and South-Central Semi-Arid Praries are brought in from [EPA Level II Ecoregions]([url](https://www.epa.gov/eco-research/ecoregions-north-america))

Additionally categories of Northern Praries and Southern Praries are created by spliting the ecoregions along the Latitude line 42.3.

Annaul SPIs are calculated within the different regions in a variety of ways (looking at different potions of years, and using 1month, 2month, and 3month SPIs. Changes in these SPIS are tracked across years.

Final Plots can be seen in the ["final plots folder" ](https://github.com/nathanchou21/2024SummerResearch/tree/main/final%20plots). One example is pictured below, showing a number of plots for the Northern Praries using 1 month SPI data and annual SPI calculated based on a variety of time ranges within the year.
