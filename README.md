Final Plots can be seen in the ["final plots folder" ](https://github.com/nathanchou21/2024SummerResearch/tree/main/final%20plots)

Data from the [North American Drought Monitor]([url](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/nadm/indices/spi/div)) is brought into GIS.

For each data pointed needed in one of the final plots, SPI statistics are interpolated to a raster file covering the areas of interest.

Boundaries from Temperate Praries, West-Central Semi-Arid Praries, and South-Central Semi-Arid Praries are brought in from [EPA Level II Ecoregions]([url](https://www.epa.gov/eco-research/ecoregions-north-america))

Additionally categories of Northern Praries and Southern Praries are created by spliting the ecoregions along the Latitude line 42.3.

Annaul SPIs are calculated within the different regions in a variety of ways (looking at different potions of years, and using 1 month, 2 month, and 3month SPIs). Changes in these SPIS are tracked across years.

Final Plots can be seen in the ["final plots folder" ](https://github.com/nathanchou21/2024SummerResearch/tree/main/final%20plots). One example is pictured below, showing a number of plots for the Northern Praries using 1 month SPI data and annual SPI calculated based on a variety of time ranges within the year.
